This GitHub Repo has a preconfigured Development Container configured.  When you clone this repo and open it you should be prompted by Visual Studio Code asking whether you want to open this up in a container.

## Prerequisites
 - See [my guide](https://github.com/scottmillers/vscode-devcontainers-getting-started) on how to start using Dev Containers
